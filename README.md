# cross_section_properties
Cross-sectional properties refer to various geometric and physical characteristics of a shape when viewed in a plane perpendicular to its longitudinal axis. These properties are essential in various fields such as engineering, physics, and materials science, where understanding how different shapes behave under different loads is crucial.
